# Sales Analysis - AAL  

## **Project Overview**  
AAL, a leading Australian clothing brand established in 2000, is experiencing significant business growth and is actively exploring expansion opportunities. To make informed investment decisions, the **head of Sales & Marketing (S&M)** seeks **data-driven insights** into **state-wise sales performance** and **sales strategies** for underperforming regions.  

This project involves **data wrangling, analysis, visualization, and report generation** for AALâ€™s **fourth-quarter sales data** across Australia, providing key insights to drive **strategic decision-making**.  

---

## **Objective**  
The goal is to analyze **state-wise sales performance** and provide **actionable insights** for optimizing revenue. Specifically, the project aims to:  
1. **Identify states generating the highest revenues.**  
2. **Develop sales programs for low-performing states.**  
3. **Analyze sales trends by demographic group (Kids, Women, Men, Seniors).**  
4. **Examine peak and off-peak sales periods.**  
5. **Present findings through data visualization and a comprehensive report.**

## **Dataset Description**  
The dataset (**AusApparalSales4thQrt2020.csv**) contains sales data for **the fourth quarter of 2020**, covering:  
- **State-wise Sales Data**  
- **Demographic Groups**: Kids, Women, Men, Seniors  
- **Time-of-Day Sales Trends**  
- **Sales & Units Sold**  
- **Daily, Weekly, Monthly, and Quarterly Sales Records**  

---

## **Steps to Perform**  

### **1. Data Wrangling**  
- **Check for Missing or Incorrect Values**:  
  - Use `isna()` and `notna()` functions to inspect missing data.  
  - Identify and recommend data-cleaning strategies (**drop null values or impute missing data**).  
- **Normalization**:  
  - Since different states may have different sales volumes, apply **data normalization** to standardize comparisons.  
- **Data Grouping (GroupBy)**:  
  - Analyze the impact of **data chunking vs. merging** and apply **the best approach** for summarizing sales data.  

---

### **2. Data Analysis**  
- **Descriptive Statistical Analysis**:  
  - Compute **mean, median, mode, and standard deviation** for **Sales** and **Units Sold**.  
- **Identify Sales Trends**:  
  - Determine the **highest** and **lowest revenue-generating states**.  
  - Identify the **best-selling and least-selling demographic groups**.  
- **Generate Reports**:  
  - Create **weekly, monthly, and quarterly summaries** for sales performance.  

**Libraries Used**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy.stats`  

---

### **3. Data Visualization**  
- **Construct a Sales Dashboard** using visualization libraries (`matplotlib`, `seaborn`).  
- **Key Insights Displayed on the Dashboard**:  
  - **State-wise Sales Performance** (for Kids, Women, Men, and Seniors).  
  - **Group-Wise Sales Comparison** across states.  
  - **Time-of-Day Sales Analysis**: Identify **peak** and **off-peak** hours for strategic sales optimization.  
- **Ensure Clear, Actionable Insights**:  
  - Use **daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly charts** for trend visualization.  
  - **Seaborn** is preferred due to its statistical plotting capabilities.  

**Recommended Visualizations**:  
| **Analysis Area**  | **Visualization Type** |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Descriptive Statistics** | Box Plot |
| **Sales Distribution** | Seaborn Distribution Plot |
| **State-Wise Sales Comparison** | Bar Chart |
| **Demographic Sales Trends** | Heatmap |
| **Time-of-Day Sales** | Line Chart |

### **4. Report Generation**  
- **Use JupyterLab Notebook** to document **data wrangling, analysis, and visualization**.  
- **Enhance readability with Markdown formatting** to integrate explanations with analysis.  
- **Include Data-Driven Recommendations** based on insights.
